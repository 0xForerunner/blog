About the Author

<!-- more -->

I'm an avid software engineer with a background in physics. I'm usually focussed on on some random electronics project or something that's really
captured my imagination at work. Generally everything I do is in rust if it's at all practical.

I am a [Senior Rust Engineer at World](https://world.org) where I get to build lot's of cool tech, from custom block builders that supply a chain supporting millions of users,
to ZK circuits that allow privacy preserving proofs.
