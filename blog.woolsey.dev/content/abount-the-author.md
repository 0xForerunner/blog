About the Author

<!-- more -->

I'm an avid software engineer with a background in physics. I'm usually focussed on on some random electronics project or something that's really
captured my imagination at work. Generally everything I do is in rust if it's at all practical.

After a lot of hours contributing to phpMyAdmin I received an unexpected invitation to join the team.
That day was on the 27/08/2018, a very happy day !
Since then I am a [Senior Rust Engineer at World](https://world.org).
